Help and tips:
--------------
- Long pressing a knock button also clears current input, useful if you hid the input bar
- Same works for PIN keys
- On Gingerbread, you need a Task Manager (ES Taskmanager if you don't have one) to relock the apps
- Sometimes, MasterSwitch doesn't want to relock. In this case, just force close the apps not relocking in App info and everything is fine again
